Refer to the website https://ant.isi.edu/address/browse/index.html 
for this project.

1) Use dig to find a "typical" MIT IP address, digging for mx.mit.edu.
   Report that address.

   18.4.23.30

2) According to classful addressing, is this a class A, B or C?

   Class A

3) Locate on the ISI map this address, and report by the general 
   pattern of colors the size of the block and its usage.

   The block is from 18.0.0.0 to 18.255.255.255 and used by MIT. It 
   is primarily white with a few green spots.
 
4) Zooming in find another MIT responding IP and ping it successfully.
   Send the ping transcript of the command line.

   ping was disabled for MIT IP addresses:
   andrew$ ping 18.9.61.24
   PING 18.9.61.24 (18.9.61.24): 56 data bytes
   Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
   Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
   Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
   Request timeout for icmp_seq 3
   Request timeout for icmp_seq 4

   result of  on same address are as follows:
   andrew$ nslookup 18.9.61.24
   Server:        129.171.32.1
   Address:    129.171.32.1#53

   Non-authoritative answer:
   24.61.9.18.in-addr.arpa    name = ist.mit.edu.

   Authoritative answers can be found from:
   18.in-addr.arpa    nameserver = use5.akam.net.
   18.in-addr.arpa    nameserver = eur5.akam.net.
   18.in-addr.arpa    nameserver = asia2.akam.net.
   18.in-addr.arpa    nameserver = use2.akam.net.
   ...
   ns1-173.akam.net    has AAAA address 2600:1401:2::ad


5) Use dig to find www.cs.miami.edu and report the address.

   192.31.89.16

6) According to classful addressing, is this a class A, B or C?

   Class C

7) Locate on the ISI map this address. By the shape of coloration
   of responding IP's within the class and its neighbors, is the block
   as used co-extensive with the classless class? About how many 
   addresses respond affirmative? About how many addresses respond
   definitively non-affirmative?
   
   The block is  co-extensive with the 192.31.89.0/27 (192.31.89.0 to 
   192.31.89.31) CIDR with the exception of 192.31.89.38. Approximatly
   17 addresses respond affirmatively in the range while none respond 
   definitively non-affirmative.
